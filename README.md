Whack-a-Shark
=============

The classic game with a new twist - sharks! But be careful - don't hit the dolphins!

Originally made in collaboration with Katie Welch

Known Issues/Future Plans
-------------------------

- Sometimes the game does not properly reset when starting a new game.
- An 'arcade mode' would be nice - infinite time, but increasing difficulty. 
- Not every tile should be a dolphin. Should be mostly 'open water', then the occasional dolphin (not to hit) and shark (to hit)
- An android version would be pretty cool. It would be a lot easier to play with touch controls.
